ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD 

STEPS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT

* REQUIREMENT GATHERING                 * DATA MODELLING
* STAKEHOLDERS IN PROJECTS              * BACKGROUND DESIGN 
* RAW DATA OVERVIEW                     * DATA VISUALZATION
* CONNECT WITH POWER BI                 * REPORT/DASHBOARD BUILDING
* DATA CLEANING & PROCESSING            * INSIGHTS

REQUIREMENTS :

CLIENTS WANTS TO CREATE A ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD FOR YEAR 2021 & 2022 SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE INSIGHTS ON THE BELOW CONCERN;

* PRIMARY KPI'S - TOTAL CASUALITY AND TOTAL ACCIDENT VALUES FOR CURRENT YEAR AND YOY GROWTH.
* PRIMARY KPI'S - TOTAL CASUALITY BY ACCIDENT SEVERITY FOR CURRENT YEAR AND YOY GROWTH.
* SECONDARY KI'S - TOTAL CASUALITY WITH RESPECT TO VEHICLE TYPE FOR CURRENT YEAR.
* MONTHLY TRENDS SHOWING COMPARISON OF CASUALITY FOR CURRENT YEAR AND PREVIOUS YEAR.
* CASUALITY BY ROAD TYPE FOR CURRENT YEAR.
* CURRENT YEAR CASUALITY BY AREA/LOCATION  & BY DAY/NIGHT.
* TOTAL CASUALITY AND TOTAL ACCIDENTS BY LOCATION.

STAKEHOLDERS ;

* MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT                    * TRANSPORT OPERATOR
* ROAD TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT                * PUBLIC & MEDIA.
* POLICE FORMS                             * ROAD SAFETY CORPS                       
* EMERGENCY SERVICES DEPARTMENTS

POWERBI FUNCTIONALITIES ;

* HOW TO CONNECT TO RAW DATA/FLAT FILE.
* DATA CLEANING  PROCESSING 
* TIME INTELLIGENCE FUNCTION/CALENDAR DATA TABLE IN POWERBI.
* DATA MODELLING 
* YTD AND YOY GROWTH CALCULATIONS USING DAX
* KPI AND ADVANCED KPI 
* CREATING CUSTOM COLUMNS AND MEASURES IN REPORTS.
* USING DIFFERENT CHARTS AND EXPORT TO USERS.


CRETAING NEW TABLE ;

DAX'S USED FOR DATE TABLE ;

* Date Table = CALENDAR(MIN('DATA'[Accident Date]),MAX('DATA'[Accident Date]))

* MONTH = FORMAT('Date Table'[Date],"mmm")

* MONTH NUMBER = MONTH('Date Table'[Date])

* YEAR = YEAR('Date Table'[Date])


DAX'S USED TO CREATE NEW MEASURES & COLUMNS IN DATA TABLE ;

* CY Accident Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(DATA[Accident_Index]),'Date Table'[Date])

* CYR Casualty = TOTALYTD(SUM('DATA'[Number_of_Casualties]),'Date Table'[Date])

* PY Accidents = CALCULATE(COUNT(DATA[Accident_Index]),SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date Table'[Date]))

* PY CASUALITY = CALCULATE(SUM('DATA'[Number_of_Casualties]),SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date Table'[Date]))

* YOY ACCIDENTS = ([CY Accident Count]-[PY Accidents])/[PY Accidents]

* YoY Casuality = ([CYR Casualty]-[PY CASUALITY])/[PY CASUALITY]
